		Most of the Free Cities are run on radically libertarian or even anarcho-capitalist principles.
		The first Free Cities experimented with indentured servitude, and this rapidly developed into
		widespread slavery. By now, the Free Cities collectively are a fundamentally slaveowning society
		and maintain a thriving slave trade that feeds off the terrible conditions in parts of the old
		world.

		The early Free Cities were wild places where the writ of law did not run. In some of the most
		depraved, slaves' bodies, minds and even lives were playthings of the wealthy and powerful.
		Though modern Free Cities are tremendously varied, a majority of the new communities made a
		choice about whether extreme practices were a flaw in a lawless society or one of its benefits.

		The Free Cities are sexually libertine places, and sexual slavery is ubiquitous. Some of the
		early Free Cities upheld or even strengthened traditional gender roles, expecting men to be men
		and women to be women. Others subscribed to an interesting refinement of those gender roles,
		considering any sex slave female, regardless of her biology. A small minority even went so far
		as to strongly favor societal feminization of slaves born male; in these, biologically female
		slaves were a rare sight.
